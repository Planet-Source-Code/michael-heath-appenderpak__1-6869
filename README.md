### Description

This is my update to 'A Pak File Creator'. The code is fixed but still may have file size limits. I haven't checked anything above 1.2 megs. This code could definitely be worked on to be made better. I hope someone out there will post a better way to do this. Please rate this code and leave me some comments or drop me an email. Hopefully this code can be used as an external resource file once we can get the access speed pumped up. Enjoy it folks!
